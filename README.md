Note that in order to play this you need a python interpretor on the terminal running python 2.7 and it is currently only compatible with Ubuntu/Linux systems. 

To switch to windows, all instances of: 

' raw_input ' must be replaced with ' input ' 

' os.system('clear') ' must be replaced with ' os.system('clr') ' 







Shoutout to pgibb96 for working on this with me and Preston Epps for the Blackjack section
